"# 02-ML-HousePricePrediction" 


# Project Description

In this project, we are going to implement a regression model using scikit-learn pipeline to predict house prices. (It is a regression model because our target value is continuous.)


The main aim of this project is to go through all necessary steps including data pre-processing, feature selection, and building model. We assume that gathering data sources and data analysis had been done before. So, we will learn the following concepts in this project:

working with scikit-learn library
find and fill missing values
data segeration
feture selection and backward eleminiation
data latency
fit basic ML models
use model to predict new data
model evaluation
